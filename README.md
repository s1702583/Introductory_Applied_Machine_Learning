# Code Usage:
Every folder is an independent ML module, that follows specific behaviours stated below.




# Step 1:
Get datas ready in two seperate numpy NdArrays, Xs (n by D matrix) for holding variable values, Ys (n by 1 matrix) for holding target values.

# Step 2:
Call Module.desc() for a general understanding of the working of the codes.
For example:
```python
import LinearRegression as LR

LR.desc() # Call desc() for an overview
```
